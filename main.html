    <h1>Will You Be My Valentine? üíñ</h1>

    <p>
        Amy, this website is more than just a collection of pages. It‚Äôs a love story, our love story. <br>  
        A place where I can put into words, images, and music just how much you mean to me.  
    </p>

    <p>
        We have come so far, through time, through distance, through everything that tried to keep us apart. <br>  
        And yet, here we are, stronger than ever, as if we were always meant to find our way back to each other. <br>  
        This is our first Valentine‚Äôs Day together, but it‚Äôs only the beginning‚Äîone of countless more to come, each more special than the last.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Every single day with you is a gift, a moment I cherish, a memory I hold close to my heart. <br>  
        And today, like every other day, I just want you to know that I love you beyond words, beyond time, beyond anything I could ever explain. <br>  
        You are my heart, my home, my forever.  
    </p>

    <p><strong>Happy Valentine‚Äôs, my love. xoxox ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</strong></p>
