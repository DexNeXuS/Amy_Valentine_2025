If I could have been there for everything, I would have. <br><br> To guard the nights you felt alone, <br> to hold the dreams that drifted from us, <br> To keep safe every unspoken wish that waited, growing fainter. <br><br> Now, here we are! <br> In the space that was always meant to be filled, <br> In the closeness we fought time to find. <br><br> All those lost chances, all the weight of ‚Äúwhat could have been,‚Äù <br> Falling away, leaving only this, this truth, this us.`
